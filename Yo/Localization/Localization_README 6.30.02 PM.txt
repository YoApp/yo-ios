-----(Welcome)------

Hello Translators!

-----(Format)------

/* This will be a comment I've left if I felt the text needed some explaining */
"Original text" = "translated text"

Never alter the original text.
The translated text sections is where your translation will go

ex.
/* as in block another user */
"BLOCK" = "BLOCK";

-----(Tips)------

Do not translate occurrences of "Yo"

If you see any of the following within the copy do not delete them

"%@" - These will be replaced in the application programmatically by text that doesn't need translating

"\n" - These signify that the surrounding text will be broken up into 2 lines
ex. "Hello!\n"Beautiful" will ultimately appear as: 
"Hello!" 
"Beautiful"

If you see words that are capitalized please carry their capitalization through in your translation

If you see words/phrases that are completely capitalized (in CAPS) dont feel the need to write your translations in CAPS
This will be taken care fo programmatically

Do NOT delete duplicates - the duplicates are formatted differently. Translate both and keep eachâ€™s respective format

-----(END)------

Thank you for your support!
